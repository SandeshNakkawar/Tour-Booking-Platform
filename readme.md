# Backend – Travel Booking Platform

## Overview

This folder contains the backend code for a **Travel Booking Platform**, a Node.js RESTful API for managing tours, users, reviews, and bookings. It demonstrates advanced Node.js concepts, including:

- Express.js server setup
- RESTful routing
- Authentication & authorization (JWT)
- File uploads and image processing
- MongoDB (Mongoose) data modeling
- Error handling and custom utilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- NPM

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `config.env` and update values as needed (MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.).

3. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:
   - Use scripts or import data from `dev-data/data/`.

### Running the Server

```bash
npm start
```
or (if using nodemon for development)
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on the port specified in `config.env`.

## Features

- **Tours API**: CRUD operations for tours, filtering, sorting, pagination.
- **User Authentication**: Signup, login, password reset, role-based access.
- **Reviews & Bookings**: Users can review tours and make bookings.
- **Image Uploads**: Upload and process tour images.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management.
- **API Documentation**: Postman collection included.

## Testing

- Use the provided Postman collection (`postman-collection.json`) with Postman to test all endpoints.

## Notes

- This project is structured for learning and demonstration purposes, following best practices from a Node.js bootcamp.
- For production, review security, environment, and deployment settings.
